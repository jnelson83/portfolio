 I am Jarrod Nelson, a 34 year old Applied Science graduate that was, until a couple of years ago, aiming for a career as a Geologist or Metallurgist in the mining industry. 
 
 I graduated in late 2014 just as the mining boom had well and truly cooled off. Graduate Geologist jobs that were abundant when I commenced study were now few and far between. Related employment options in Victoria at the time were quite hard to come by. A move to Western Australia was on the cards!

 I completed 50% of the required study for a Graduate Diploma in Metallurgy via distance eduction through Curtin University in Kalgoorlie, WA. I enjoyed the coursework as well as the practical activities requiring travel to Kalgoorlie, however I did not have the pre-requisite advanced mathematics background to proceed further and have a realistic chance of passing the units that I had left. Postgraduate study is expensive!

 As I had travelled to Kalgoorlie twice in the previous 12 months for practical sessions, I had become familiar with the city and sought to temporarily move there with the aim of finding accomodation and some casual work in the mining industry. I was not financially prepared for the elevated cost of living in a mining town and as a result I returned to Ballarat, Victoria a couple of weeks later.

 Disheartened and, to be honest, disillusioned with working in the mining industry across the other side of the country from my friends and loved ones, I decided that a career change was in my future. 
 
 I soon found employment with an environmental testing company where I would be using skills I had aquired during my study to identify asbestos fibres in samples of soil and construction materials. While it is an interesting field, I was not comfortable with the potential exposure hazards associated with the job and as such I left that position after 6 months.

### Path to becoming a web developer
Until a few years ago programming had always seemed to me like something that if you didn't pick it up at a young age then you could never learn it well enough to find work. Wow, was I wrong!!

I had dabbled with BASIC when I was about 14, I followed along with an older friend's text book. It did not last.
My first experience building webpages was back in Year 10 when I used Microsoft Frontpage to build pages in a WYSIWYG format. I'm glad the internet has progressed past those days! I pieced together a crude Geocities page back then too.
I picked up bits of HTML over the years just through trial and error writing forum posts and the like. Nothing serious.
I used some SQL expressions during my undergraduate study as part of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) unit.

I have been on a quest to learn web development for the past couple of months, pretty much since February, 2018. I have covered the following:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript (early stages)
* Python (early stages)
* jQuery (just scratched the surface)
* Hugo (static site generator) - I have used it to produce a few websites that are at various stages of development, including this one.
* Markdown (getting better each time I use it)
* Git (a steep learning curve!)

I started off following a program called 'The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery' on Udemy taught by Andrei Neagoie. He is an engaging teacher and he has built a vibrant Slack community that folows along with the course. There are periodic coding challenges and other activities to participate it. It is well worth the $15AUD or so that I paid to access it.

To supplement my learning I signed up to [Code Academy](https://www.codeacademy.com) but quickly found it to be lacking in actual projects and things that allowed me to cement the things I had covered to memory. It exposes the student to many facets of web development but, in my opinion, does not go deep enough into the topics covered.

So to replace [Code Academy](https://www.codeacademy.com) I started the Front End Development Certification. I have found it much more engaging than the program offered at [Code Academy](https://www.codeacademy.com). As of 5/5/2018, I am up to the Basic Javascript section.

Free Code Camp and Hugo

Personal Portfolio page from scratch with HTML and CSS - 50 hours across a tribute page (I wrote mine on Richard Feynman) and a personal portfolio webpage. The tribute page took me maybe 2 hours, so I can safely assume that the portfolio page will not take me another 48 hours to complete. I estimate maybe 4 or so hours to get it done.

## Update

I spent 4 and a bit hours building my portfolio from scratch, it was quite liberating to find out what I can get done with minimal help from documentation. The site is still incredibly raw but it is probably 85% finished.

I probably watched 30 minutes of youtube tutorials prior to starting on the new site. I had been piecing one together after building a skeleton of content. I discovered that it is more beneficial to layout the site using the grid before adding content. An analogy could be laying down a solid foundation comes before building walls and painting the ceiling.

Free Code Camp and Hugo

Personal Portfolio page from scratch with HTML and CSS - 50 hours across a tribute page (I wrote mine on Richard Feynman) and a personal portfolio webpage. The tribute page took me maybe 2 hours, so I can safely assume that the portfolio page will not take me another 48 hours to complete. I estimate maybe 4 or so hours to get it done.

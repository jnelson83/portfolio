Day 1 of my coding challenge!

I have committed to writing code each day for 100 continuous days. I plan on devoting at least 4 hours per day to achieving this goal. I hope to also set aside 15-30 minutes at the end of my code writing to reflect and compose my daily blog post about what I tackled and any thought or notes I have about it. 

This blog will act as a future record for other aspiring web developers to see what I went through and how I did it. It will also serve as somewhat of a crude journal so I can more easily plan my method of ensuring adequate progress is being made so I don't become complacent and lose motivation.

My dev environment is as follows:

* I am using a desktop PC with two monitors - one portrait, one landscape (3 would be better).
* I have a Lenovo T420S laptop (bulletproof!) that I intend to get used to coding on for when I am away from my home PC.
* Code is written in Microsoft Visual Studio Code (I started with Sublime Text 3).
* I use the integrated terminal in VS Code also (It is much more efficient workflow).
* Anything worth keeping will be stored in a Github repository.
* Projects I complete during my training will be pushed to Github and displayed in the [Portfolio](/portfolio) section of this website.
* I will be developing a longer-term side project soon, the progress of which will be displayed on my [Portfolio](/portfolio) page also.
* As of writing this I am toying with the idea of leaving it all up in my portfolio page to see how much I have progressed over the journey, warts and all, I'm sure future Jarrod will disagree with this.

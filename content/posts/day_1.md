Day 1 of my coding challenge!

I have committed to writing code each day for 100 continuous days. I plan on devoting at least 4 hours per day to achieving this goal. I hope to also set aside 15-30 minutes at the end of my code writing to reflect and compose my daily blog post about what I tackled and any thought or notes I have about it. 

This blog will act as a future record for other aspiring web developers to see what I went through and how I did it. It will also serve as somewhat of a crude journal so I can more easily plan my method of ensuring adequate progress is being made so I don't become complacent and lose motivation.

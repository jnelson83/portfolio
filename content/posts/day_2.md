[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator built with [Go](https://golang.org/). It is a similar framework to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but has a much quicker build time and is widely used in the community. There is an abundance of themes to use as a building block to quickly get your content out for the masses to read.

I first learned of static site generators about 18 months ago when I was looking to build a site for a business venture. I sought out an alternative to Squarespace, Wix, and the like. I felt the cost was unnecessary when I could most likely apply myself and end up with a better result.

Jekyll was mind-blowing in it's output, simple static websites that loaded quickly and were easy to add content to using Markdown.
